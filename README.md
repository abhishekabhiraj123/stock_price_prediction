Introduction
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using the ARIMA model, a popular time series forecasting technique. ARIMA models are capable of capturing different aspects of a time series dataset, making them suitable for predicting stock prices.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Statsmodels
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd stock-price-prediction
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script for training and testing the ARIMA model.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in the data/ directory. You can replace it with your own dataset if you wish to analyze different stock data.

ARIMA Model
The ARIMA model is a widely used time series forecasting technique that combines autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components with differencing to handle non-stationary data.

In this project, we apply the ARIMA model to historical stock price data to make future predictions.

Results
The results of the ARIMA model predictions can be found in the results/ directory. This includes visualizations and evaluation metrics.
